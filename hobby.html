      <h3>1. Watching movies</h3>
      <p align="justify">I have watched many kinds of movies in semester break. 
      The genre is not a problem but the storyline is what we need to overlook. 
      Depends on my mood,  sometimes I would prefer comedy and sometimes horror film. 
      But the most comfortable to watch is romantic movies. 
      After watching a lot of movies, I know a lot of information either current or history. 
      Some knowledge might not made up in class so we can get the knowledge from watching movies experience.

      <h3>2. Drawing</h3>
      <p align="justify">Drawing is my passion. I think I got this skill from my father because he loved to draw when he was young. 
      That's what he said to me. The feeling when you think you want to draw something but it needs a lot of patience to learn how the work will be going. 
      The shape and the colour is important to people recognize the drawing itself. Sadly, I did not apply art course for entering university. 
      I think it might be tough for me if I learned something I like but with pressure. Surely the feeling to draw is not the same anymore. 
      Then I choose another course that I think it suits me. If I need to choose either drawing potraits or cartoon, I cannot simply choose it. 
      Both of the options are my cup of tea. However, lately I have no much time to draw because a lot of work need to be done in a short period. 
      Maybe when the semester break started, I want to draw again.
